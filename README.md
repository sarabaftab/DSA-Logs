# DSA Logs

This repository contains solutions to the NeetCode 150 challenge, covering essential Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from LeetCode. The goal is to build a strong foundation in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

## Repository Structure

- Each file corresponds to a different problem from the NeetCode 150 list.
- Solutions are implemented in Python (may expand to other languages later).
- Optimized approaches and explanations are included where necessary.

## Purpose

- Track progress through the NeetCode 150 Challenge.
- Share solutions for reference and learning.
- Improve coding skills and algorithmic problem-solving.

## Contributions

This is a personal practice repository, but others are welcome to explore the solutions.
